  /usr/local/share/zsh/site-functions

Emacs Lisp files have been installed to:

==> readline
readline is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /usr/local,
because macOS provides BSD libedit.

For compilers to find readline you may need to set:
  export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/readline/lib"
  export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/readline/include"

For pkg-config to find readline you may need to set:
  export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/usr/local/opt/readline/lib/pkgconfig"

A sample of the default configuration has been installed to:
  /usr/local/opt/tig/share/tig/examples/tigrc

==> gnu-getopt
gnu-getopt is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /usr/local,
because macOS already provides this software and installing another version in
parallel can cause all kinds of trouble.

If you need to have gnu-getopt first in your PATH run:
  echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/gnu-getopt/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc


Bash completion has been installed to:
  /usr/local/opt/gnu-getopt/etc/bash_completion.d
==> libffi
libffi is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /usr/local,
because macOS already provides this software and installing another version in
parallel can cause all kinds of trouble.

For compilers to find libffi you may need to set:
  export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/libffi/lib"
  export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/libffi/include"

For pkg-config to find libffi you may need to set:
  export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/usr/local/opt/libffi/lib/pkgconfig"

==> libtool
In order to prevent conflicts with Apple's own libtool we have prepended a "g"
so, you have instead: glibtool and glibtoolize.
==> guile
Guile libraries can now be installed here:
    Source files: /usr/local/share/guile/site/3.0
  Compiled files: /usr/local/lib/guile/3.0/site-ccache
      Extensions: /usr/local/lib/guile/3.0/extensions

Add the following to your .bashrc or equivalent:
  export GUILE_LOAD_PATH="/usr/local/share/guile/site/3.0"
  export GUILE_LOAD_COMPILED_PATH="/usr/local/lib/guile/3.0/site-ccache"
  export GUILE_SYSTEM_EXTENSIONS_PATH="/usr/local/lib/guile/3.0/extensions"
==> openssl@1.1
A CA file has been bootstrapped using certificates from the system
keychain. To add additional certificates, place .pem files in
  /usr/local/etc/openssl@1.1/certs

and run
  /usr/local/opt/openssl@1.1/bin/c_rehash

openssl@1.1 is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /usr/local,
because macOS provides LibreSSL.

If you need to have openssl@1.1 first in your PATH run:
  echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/openssl@1.1/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc

For compilers to find openssl@1.1 you may need to set:
  export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/openssl@1.1/lib"
  export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/openssl@1.1/include"

For pkg-config to find openssl@1.1 you may need to set:
  export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/usr/local/opt/openssl@1.1/lib/pkgconfig"

==> unbound
To have launchd start unbound now and restart at startup:
  sudo brew services start unbound

to your .bashrc or equivalent in order for Guile to find the TLS certificates
database:
  export GUILE_TLS_CERTIFICATE_DIRECTORY=/usr/local/etc/gnutls/

To use the Heroku CLI's autocomplete --
  Via homebrew's shell completion:
    1) Follow homebrew's install instructions https://docs.brew.sh/Shell-Completion

              and called, either explicitly or via a framework like oh-my-zsh.
    2) Then run
      $ heroku autocomplete --refresh-cache

  OR

  Use our standalone setup:
    1) Run and follow the install steps:
      $ heroku autocomplete
